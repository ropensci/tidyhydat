\title{Download a tibble of realtime river data from the last 30 days from the Meteorological Service of Canada datamart}
\format{A tibble with 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{STATION_NUMBER}{Unique 7 digit Water Survey of Canada station number}
  \item{PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC}{The province, territory or state in which the station is located}
  \item{Date}{Observation date and time for last thirty days. Formatted as a POSIXct class in UTC for consistency.}
  \item{Parameter}{Parameter being measured. Only possible values are Flow and Level}
  \item{Value}{Value of the measurement. If Parameter equals Flow the units are m^3/s. 
  If Parameter equals Level the units are metres.}
  \item{Grade}{reserved for future use}
  \item{Symbol}{reserved for future use}
  \item{Code}{quality assurance/quality control flag for the discharge}
  \item{station_tz}{Station timezone based on tidyhydat::allstations$station_tz}
}}
\usage{
realtime_dd(station_number = NULL, prov_terr_state_loc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_number}{A seven digit Water Survey of Canada station number. If this argument is omitted, the value of \code{prov_terr_state_loc}
is returned.}

\item{prov_terr_state_loc}{Province, state or territory. If this argument is omitted, the value of \code{station_number}
is returned. See \code{unique(allstations$prov_terr_state_loc)}. Will also accept \code{CA} to return only Canadian stations.}
}
\value{
A tibble of water flow and level values.

\description{
Download realtime river data from the last 30 days from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) datamart. 
The function will prioritize downloading data collected at the highest resolution. In instances where data is 
not available at high (hourly or higher) resolution daily averages are used. Currently, if a station does not 
exist or is not found, no data is returned.

## Download from multiple provinces
realtime_dd(station_number=c("01CD005","08MF005"))
