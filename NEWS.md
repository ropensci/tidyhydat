- fix bug where `download_hydat()` fails if `tempdir()` is on a different device than `hydat_path` (@mpdavison, #192)

# tidyhydat 0.6.1
- Add `...` to print methods so you can pass arguments all the way down. 
- Add workaround for vroom#519 bug that prevents `realtime_*` functions from working
- `realtime_ws` now returns the `Approval/Approbation` column as a character vector rather than a integer. ECCC is now putting non-integers in that column so this is a less strict formatting solution. 

# tidyhydat 0.6.0
- Add capability to access ECCC webservice. The return of `realtime_ws`!

# tidyhydat 0.5.9
- drop `.data` pronoun throughout
- fixed failing CRAN test

# tidyhydat 0.5.8
- fix bug where hydat folder was not being created

# tidyhydat 0.5.7
- new `hy_remote` function which looks to see what version is available from ECCC (#183)
- Improved logic to download HYDAT even if there is some clutter present (@gdelaplante #180)
- Updated to work with coming changes to dbplyr (#179)
- Use testthat 3rd edition and update a bunch of tests
- Make tinyhydat even tinier to remove R CMD check note

# tidyhydat 0.5.6
- fixed CRAN document issue
- fixed bug created by HYDAT database name (#175)

# tidyhydat 0.5.5

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- `download_hydat()` now has an `ask` parameter that can be used to bypass the keypress confirmation when downloading the HYDAT database (@rchlumsk, #165). 
- Change maintainer email. 
- Precompile vignettes for CRAN
- Minor tweaks to vignettes

# tidyhydat 0.5.4
- When add a local timezone column, use the most common timezone in the data rather than the first one. This just seems more likely to be useful to users
- Add more documentation to `realtime_add_local_datetime` to make how timezones are dealt with clearer (#157)
- Expose the query time for realtime functions as an attribute (#160)
- Add Government of Canada as data contributor (#156)

# tidyhydat 0.5.3
- Allow pkg to loaded without internet and rather just issue an message when it is not. (#149)
- Added `add = TRUE` to all `on.exit` call so add not to overwrite previous call (#151)
- Remove redundant and ill-advised  `closeAllConnections` (#153)
- Update internal data
- Convert most of the docs to markdown (#121)

# tidyhydat 0.5.2
- add internal function `hy_check` to verify that HYDAT contains all the right tables and that those tables contain data. 

# tidyhydat 0.5.1
- Replace `class(x) ==` with `inherits`
- Fix bug and added corresponding tests where a request for multiple stations to `realtime_dd` would fail if any data was missing
- Update internal data
- Fix all non-secure or borken links

# tidyhydat 0.5.0

### MINOR FIXES
- Revise multi prov test to realtime because of network load and prone to intermittent failure
- Adding rOpenSci doc site to DESCRIPTION
- Fix character NA's in `hy_stations` (#125)
- Allow downloading HYDAT to alternative locations (#129)
- Provide better documentation of how change default db location in `hy_set_default_db()`

# tidyhydat 0.4.0


### IMPROVEMENTS
* All functions now return either "hy" or "realtime" class with associated print and plot methods (#119)
* prov_terr_state_loc now accepts a "CA" value to specify only stations located in Canada (#112)
* functions that access internet resources now fail with an informative error message (#116)
* tests that require internet resources are skipped when internet is down 
* Add small join example to calculate runoff to introduction vignette (#120)

### BUG FIXES
* `pull_station_number` now only returns unique values (#109)
* Adding a offset column that reflects OlsonNames() and is thus DST independent (#110)
* Caught all `R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION` instances

# tidyhydat 0.3.5

### IMPROVEMENTS
* New function: `realtime_add_local_datetime()` adds a local datetime column to `realtime_dd()` tibble (#64)
* New function: `pull_station_number()` wraps `pull(STATION_NUMBER)` for convenience

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES
* In effort to standardize, the case of column names for some rarely used function outputs were changed to reflect more commonly used function outputs. This may impact some workflows where columns are referenced by names (#99).   

### BUG FIXES
* Functions that have a `start_date` and `end_date` actually work with said argument (#98)
* `hy_annual_instant_peaks()` now parses the date correctly into UTC and includes a datetime and time zone column.  (#64)
* `hy_stn_data_range()` now returns actual `NA`'s rather than string NA's (#97)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENT
* `download_hydat()` now returns an informative error if the download fails due to proxy-related connection issues (@rywhale, #101). 

# tidyhydat 0.3.4

### IMPROVEMENT
* Added rlang as a dependency and applied tidyeval idiom to more safety control variable environments
* 15% speed improvement in `realtime_dd` by eliminating loop (#91)
* 40% speed improvement when querying full provinces (#89)
* reorganized file naming so that helper functions are placed in utils-* files

### BUG FIXES
* Fixed `hy_monthly_flows` and `hy_monthly_levels` date issue (#24)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENT
* realtime tidying now not duplicated and is handled by a function
* simplified `tidyhydat:::station_choice` and added more unit testing
* no longer outputting a message when `station_number = "ALL"`.
* Exporting pipe (`%>%`)

# tidyhydat 0.3.3

### NEW FEATURES
  * Open a connection to the HYDAT database directly using `hy_src()` for advanced functionality (PR#77).
  * New vignette outlining `hy_src()` (PR#77)
  * Add some tools to improve the usability of the test database (PR#77).
  * `download_hydat()` now uses `httr::GET()`

  * Fixed margin error in `hy_plot()`
  * Fixed a bug in `realtime_plot()` that prevented a lake level station from being called
  * Fixed a bug in `hy_daily()` that threw an error when only a level station was called
  * Added new tests for `hy_daily()` and `realtime_plot()`
  * Added `HYD_STATUS` and `REAL_TIME` columns to `allstations`. 


# tidyhydat 0.3.2

### BUG FIXES
  * Fixed bug in `download_hydat()` that create a path that wasn't OS-independent.
  * Fixed a bug on `download_hydat()` where by sometimes R had trouble overwriting an existing version of existing database. Now the old database is simply deleted before the new one is downloaded.
  * `hy_annual_instant_peaks()` now returns a date object with HOUR, MINUTE and TIME_ZONE returned as separed columns. (#10)
  * All variable values of LEVEL and FLOW have been changed to Level and Flow to match the output of `hy_data_types`. (#60)
  * Tidier and coloured error messages throughout.
  * Review field incorrectly specified the rOpenSci review page. Removed the link from the DESCRIPTION.
  


# tidyhydat 0.3.1

### NEW FEATURES

  * `.onAttach()` checks if HYDAT is downloaded on package load.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
  * Significant function and argument name changes (see below)
  * Adding `rappdirs` to imports and using to generate download path for `download_hydat()` (#44)
