## What does `tidyhydat` do?

- Provides functions (`hy_*`) that access hydrometric data from the HYDAT database, a national archive of Canadian hydrometric data and return tidy data.
- Provides functions (`realtime_*`) that access Environment and Climate Change Canada's real-time hydrometric data source.
- Provides functions (`search_*`) that can search through the approximately 7000 stations in the database and aid in generating station vectors
- Keep functions as simple as possible. For example, for daily flows, the `hy_daily_flows()` function queries the database, *tidies* the data and returns a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) of daily flows.

## Installation
You can install `tidyhydat` from CRAN:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyhydat")
```


To install the development version of the `tidyhydat` package, you can install directly from the rOpenSci development server:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyhydat", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")
```

## Usage
More documentation on `tidyhydat` can found at the rOpenSci doc page: https://docs.ropensci.org/tidyhydat/

When you install `tidyhydat`, several other packages will be installed as well. One of those packages, `dplyr`, is useful for data manipulations and is used regularly here. To use actually use `dplyr` in a session you must explicitly load it. A helpful `dplyr` tutorial can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).
  
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyhydat)
library(dplyr)
```
  
### HYDAT download
To use many of the functions in the `tidyhydat` package you will need to download a version of the HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change Canada's database of historical hydrometric data then tell R where to find the database. Conveniently `tidyhydat` does all this for you via:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
download_hydat()
```
This downloads (with your permission) the most recent version of HYDAT and then saves it in a location on your computer where `tidyhydat`'s function will look for it. Do be patient though as this can take a long time! To see where HYDAT was saved you can run `hy_default_db()`. Now that you have HYDAT downloaded and ready to go, you are all set to begin looking at Canadian hydrometric data.

### Real-time
To download real-time data using the datamart we can use approximately the same conventions discussed above. Using `realtime_dd()` we can easily select specific stations by supplying a station of interest:
```{r}
realtime_dd(station_number = "08MF005")
```

Or we can use `realtime_ws`:

```{r}
realtime_ws(
  station_number = "08MF005",
  parameters = c(46, 5), ## see param_id for a list of codes
  start_date = Sys.Date() - 14,
  end_date = Sys.Date()
)
```

## Compare realtime_ws and realtime_dd
`tidyhydat` provides two methods to download realtime data. `realtime_dd()` provides a function to import .csv files from [here](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/hydrometric/csv/). 
`realtime_ws()` is an client for a web service hosted by ECCC. `realtime_ws()` has several difference to `realtime_dd()`. These include:

- *Speed*: The `realtime_ws()` is much faster for larger queries (i.e. many stations). For single station queries to `realtime_dd()` is more appropriate.
- *Length of record*: `realtime_ws()` records goes back further in time. 
- *Type of parameters*: `realtime_dd()` are restricted to river flow (either flow and level) data. In contrast `realtime_ws()` can download several different parameters depending on what is available for that station. See `data("param_id")` for a list and explanation of the parameters.
- *Date/Time filtering*: `realtime_ws()` provides argument to select a date range. Selecting a data range with `realtime_dd()` is not possible until after all files have been downloaded. 

### Plotting

Plot methods are also provided to quickly visualize realtime data:
```{r}
realtime_ex <- realtime_dd(station_number = "08MF005")

plot(realtime_ex)
```

and also historical data:
```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=12}
hy_ex <- hy_daily_flows(station_number = "08MF005", start_date = "2013-01-01")

plot(hy_ex)
```
