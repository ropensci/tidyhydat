## What does `tidyhydat` do?

-   Provides functions (`hy_*`) that access hydrometric data from the
    HYDAT database, a national archive of Canadian hydrometric data and
    return tidy data.
-   Provides functions (`realtime_*`) that access Environment and
    Climate Change Canada’s real-time hydrometric data source.
-   Provides functions (`search_*`) that can search through the
    approximately 7000 stations in the database and aid in generating
    station vectors
-   Keep functions as simple as possible. For example, for daily flows,
    the `hy_daily_flows()` function queries the database, *tidies* the
    data and returns a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) of daily
    flows.

## Installation

You can install `tidyhydat` from CRAN:

    install.packages("tidyhydat")

To install the development version of the `tidyhydat` package, you can
install directly from the rOpenSci development server:

    install.packages("tidyhydat", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")

## Usage

More documentation on `tidyhydat` can found at the rOpenSci doc page:
<https://docs.ropensci.org/tidyhydat/>

When you install `tidyhydat`, several other packages will be installed
as well. One of those packages, `dplyr`, is useful for data
manipulations and is used regularly here. To use actually use `dplyr` in
a session you must explicitly load it. A helpful `dplyr` tutorial can be
found
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).

    library(tidyhydat)
    library(dplyr)

### HYDAT download

To use many of the functions in the `tidyhydat` package you will need to
download a version of the HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change
Canada’s database of historical hydrometric data then tell R where to
find the database. Conveniently `tidyhydat` does all this for you via:

    download_hydat()

This downloads (with your permission) the most recent version of HYDAT
and then saves it in a location on your computer where `tidyhydat`’s
function will look for it. Do be patient though as this can take a long
time! To see where HYDAT was saved you can run `hy_default_db()`. Now
that you have HYDAT downloaded and ready to go, you are all set to begin
looking at Canadian hydrometric data.

### Real-time

To download real-time data using the datamart we can use approximately
the same conventions discussed above. Using `realtime_dd()` we can
easily select specific stations by supplying a station of interest:

    realtime_dd(station_number = "08MF005")
    #>   Queried on: 2024-01-09 05:08:33.18974 (UTC)
    #>   Date range: 2023-12-10 to 2024-01-09 
    #> # A tibble: 10,972 × 8

    #>  1 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:00:00
    #>  2 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:05:00
    #>  3 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:10:00
    #>  4 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:15:00
    #>  5 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:20:00
    #>  6 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:25:00
    #>  7 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:30:00
    #>  8 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:35:00
    #>  9 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:40:00
    #> 10 08MF005        BC                  2023-12-10 08:45:00
    #> # ℹ 10,962 more rows
    #> # ℹ 5 more variables: Parameter <chr>, Value <dbl>,
    #> #   Grade <chr>, Symbol <chr>, Code <chr>

Or we can use `realtime_ws`:

    realtime_ws(
      station_number = "08MF005",
      parameters = c(46, 5), ## see param_id for a list of codes
      start_date = Sys.Date() - 14,
      end_date = Sys.Date()
    )
    #> All station successfully retrieved
    #> All parameters successfully retrieved
    #> # A tibble: 1,323 × 10
    #>    STATION_NUMBER Date                Name_En    Value Unit 
    #>    <chr>          <dttm>              <chr>      <dbl> <chr>

## Compare realtime\_ws and realtime\_dd

`tidyhydat` provides two methods to download realtime data.
`realtime_dd()` provides a function to import .csv files from
[here](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/hydrometric/csv/). `realtime_ws()` is an
client for a web service hosted by ECCC. `realtime_ws()` has several
difference to `realtime_dd()`. These include:

-   *Speed*: The `realtime_ws()` is much faster for larger queries
    (i.e. many stations). For single station queries to `realtime_dd()`
    is more appropriate.
-   *Length of record*: `realtime_ws()` records goes back further in
    time.
-   *Type of parameters*: `realtime_dd()` are restricted to river flow
    (either flow and level) data. In contrast `realtime_ws()` can
    download several different parameters depending on what is available
    for that station. See `data("param_id")` for a list and explanation
    of the parameters.
-   *Date/Time filtering*: `realtime_ws()` provides argument to select a
    date range. Selecting a data range with `realtime_dd()` is not
    possible until after all files have been downloaded.

### Plotting

Plot methods are also provided to quickly visualize realtime data:

    realtime_ex <- realtime_dd(station_number = "08MF005")

    plot(realtime_ex)

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

and also historical data:

    hy_ex <- hy_daily_flows(station_number = "08MF005", start_date = "2013-01-01")

    plot(hy_ex)
